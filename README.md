# #100DaysOfCode
This file contains mini projects that I created with Python to practice my coding skills consistently as part of the 100days of code challenge. The purpose is to stay committed to developing my skills and creating new projects every day.

### Day 1 - [Roll The Dice Stimulator](RollDice.py):
The code stimulates rolling a dice. When the code runs, the computer chooses a random number between (1,6) inclusively in which each number in the assigned range represents a side of the dice.

### Day 2 - [Rock, Paper & Scissors Game](RockPaperScissors.py):
The code stimulates Rock, Paper & Scissors game. The user is given two options: either to play against the computer or to play with another player. Whoever reaches the score of 3 first is the winner, then the user is asked whether they want to play another round or to exit the game.
